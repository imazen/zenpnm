# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Adopt the `zencodec` `CategorizedError` taxonomy (PR #103).** `BitmapError`
  now `impl zencodec::CategorizedError` with
  `codec_name() = Some("zenbitmaps")` and an exhaustive `category()` mapping every
  variant to one coarse `ErrorCategory`, so consumers route on the category
  (HTTP status, retry policy, logging) without naming the enum. `Cancelled`
  delegates to `StopReason` (`Cancelled`/`TimedOut`) and `UnsupportedOperation`
  delegates to the zencodec cause type. Limits map to the representative
  `LimitKind` (`DimensionsTooLarge`/`LimitExceeded` → `Pixels`, since both are
  size/overflow guards and the always-on default pixel cap dominates;
  `LimitExceeded` is a stringly catch-all whose precise sub-kind lives in the
  message). `InvalidHeader`/`InvalidData` → `MalformedImage`,
  `UnexpectedEof` → `UnexpectedEof`, `BufferTooSmall`/`LayoutMismatch` →
  `InvalidBuffer`, `UnrecognizedFormat` → `UnsupportedImageType`.
- **The six per-format codec adapters now return the shared
  `whereat::At<zencodec::CodecError>` envelope (Pattern B) at the `zencodec`
  trait boundary**, instead of the native `At<BitmapError>`. The envelope carries
  the `ErrorCategory` + codec name as data, so a generic consumer recovers them
  *through `Dyn*` dispatch* — after `DynDecoderConfig`/`DynEncoderConfig` erases
  the concrete error to `Box<dyn Error>`, the category and `Some("zenbitmaps")`
  are still recoverable via `CodecErrorExt` (`error_category()` / `codec_error()`),
  which the bare `At<BitmapError>` could not survive once erased. A
  `From<BitmapError> for At<CodecError>` bridge (`CodecError::of` + `start_at`)
  drives the conversion; `BitmapError` is unchanged and stays the **native** error
  of the crate's bare `decode()`/`encode()` API (`crate::Result` is still
  `At<BitmapError>`) and the detail + category source behind the envelope. A
  `Dyn`-dispatch test asserts the category + codec name survive erasure (the proof
  the native error could not pass). (#18)
- New `BitmapError::UnsupportedPixelFormat(String)` variant, split out from the
  encode-side cases of `UnsupportedVariant`: it is the "the caller's pixel
  buffer format can't be encoded to this output format" negotiation failure
  (mapping to `ErrorCategory::UnsupportedPixelFormat`), distinct from the
  residual `UnsupportedVariant` "a feature within a recognized format isn't
  supported" (→ `UnsupportedImageFeature`). Wired at all 17 encode-side
  construction sites (PNM/BMP/QOI/TGA/HDR/farbfeld encoders + the `zencodec`
  encode adapters); the 14 encode-layout-rejection tests were updated to match
  the narrower variant. Additive — `UnsupportedVariant` is retained for the
  decode-side feature cases, so this is non-breaking on the `#[non_exhaustive]`
  enum.
- Honor `zencodec::AllocPreference` (3-mode, per-site) at untrusted decode
  allocations, and implement `estimate_decode_resources` for all six bitmap
  `DecoderConfig`s. Each format's full-image output buffer (sized from the
  untrusted header dimensions) now defaults to the fallible `try_reserve` path —
  a malicious header gets a graceful `BitmapError::LimitExceeded` rather than an
  abort — while bounded per-row / palette scratch keeps the fast infallible
  `vec!`. `ResourceLimits::prefer_fallible_allocations` overrides every site at
  the zencodec decode boundary (`Fallible`/`Infallible` force one path,
  `CodecDefault` keeps each site's default); the bare `decode()` API is
  unchanged. New crate-local `AllocPref` (mirror of `AllocPreference`, keeping
  the always-compiled decode pipeline decoupled from the codec-boundary type) +
  `alloc_util`
  helpers. `estimate_decode_resources` delegates to a shared
  `codec::trivial_decode_resources`: working set ≈ output buffer only
  (`ThreadingInformation::SERIAL`, core-adjusted), structural not calibrated.
- vCPU-aware resource estimation via zencodec's unified `estimate` API. All six
  bitmap `EncoderConfig`s (PNM, BMP, farbfeld, HDR, TGA, QOI) now override
  `estimate_encode_resources(&ImageCharacteristics, &ComputeEnvironment)`,
  returning a core-adjusted `ResourceEstimate`. They share a
  `codec::trivial_encode_resources` helper: these formats encode in a single
  serial pass (`ThreadingInformation::SERIAL`) with peak ≈ input + output and a
  linear pixel-count time term. The per-format output ratios (~1.0× for the raw
  formats, ~0.6× for QOI) are structural placeholders, not a measured fit.

### Changed

- **`zencodec` is now a required, always-on dependency (was an optional cargo
  feature).** The trait integration — `EncoderConfig`/`DecoderConfig` adapters,
  streaming decode/encode, probe, CICP, and the `CategorizedError` taxonomy — is
  compiled unconditionally; the `zencodec` cargo feature is removed (no more
  `--features zencodec`). `zencodec` is `#![no_std] + alloc`, so this imposes no
  `std` requirement and the `no_std`/wasm builds are unaffected (verified
  `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`). The `zenpixels`,
  `zenpixels-convert`, `imgref`, and `rgb` crates the adapters use directly are
  now unconditional dependencies; the `rgb`/`imgref` cargo features remain but
  only gate the extra typed-pixel convenience surface on the bare decode/encode
  API.
- deps: TEMP `[patch.crates-io] zencodec = { git, branch =
  "cancellation-classification-99" }` to pull the unreleased `CategorizedError`
  taxonomy (PR #103). Remove this patch and bump the `zencodec` version
  dependency once 0.1.26 is published.
- deps: migrate to published zencodec 0.1.24 estimate API; drop the temporary
  `[patch.crates-io] zencodec = { git, rev = "0f71295" }` pin (the `estimate` API
  is now on crates.io). The shared `codec::trivial_encode_resources` helper follows
  the refined `ResourceEstimate` API: `ResourceEstimate::new(typ, time_ms as u64)`
  (`wall_ms` is now `u64`, was `f32`), `.with_peak_max(typ + input)` (replaces the
  dropped `.with_peak_range(min, max)`), and the `.with_output_bytes(..)` call is
  gone. All six codec configs delegate to it, so the change is one site.
- **BREAKING (0.2.0):** the public error type is now `At<BitmapError>`
  (`whereat::At` wrapping the `BitmapError` enum), re-exported as
  `zenbitmaps::At` alongside a `pub type Result<T> = Result<T, At<BitmapError>>`.
  Every `decode*`/`encode*`/`probe_bmp` entry point — and the `zencodec`
  adapters' associated `Error` types — now return the wrapped form, which
  carries a captured `file:line` location (and, via
  `whereat::define_at_crate_info!`, a GitHub source link) for server-side
  stack traces on malformed-input failures. **Migration:** match on the inner
  enum through `err.error()` (returns `&BitmapError`), e.g.
  `matches!(result.as_ref().map_err(|e| e.error()), Err(BitmapError::LimitExceeded(_)))`
  or `match err.error() { BitmapError::UnrecognizedFormat => .. }`. The
  `BitmapError` enum itself (variant names, `#[non_exhaustive]`) is unchanged;
  only the wrapper is new. Bumps to 0.2.0 (leftmost-non-zero 0.x break).
- Decode now applies a default 120 MP pixel cap (`DEFAULT_MAX_PIXELS`) even when
  no explicit `Limits` are supplied, matching the always-on 1 GiB
  `DEFAULT_MAX_MEMORY_BYTES` byte cap and the wider fleet's 120 MP house
  convention. **Behavior change:** a header declaring more than 120 MP is now
  rejected at the pre-flight dimension check before allocation, whereas
  previously the byte cap alone admitted far larger pixel counts for low-bpp
  formats (e.g. a ~1 G grayscale-px header fit under 1 GiB and decoded). The
  dimension check (`check_dimensions`) now reads the default via `unwrap_or`,
  so it fires on the no-limits path the same way the byte cap already did.
  Opt out by setting `Limits { max_pixels: Some(u64::MAX), .. }`; set a
  smaller `max_pixels` to lower the ceiling. Closes #13. Regression:
  `tests/default_pixel_cap.rs` + `limits::tests`.

### Fixed

- **PAM re-encode roundtrip is now lossless for 16-bit ASCII PPM (fuzz
  zenbitmaps#10).** A binary P6 16-bit PPM downscales to `Rgb8` (there is no
  16-bit RGB layout), but the ASCII P3 path keyed its output byte width on
  `maxval > 255` alone and emitted *two* bytes per sample while still tagging the
  buffer `Rgb8` — producing, e.g., a 6-byte 1×1 "Rgb8" image. `encode_pam` then
  copied `width·height·channels` (3) bytes, truncating the buffer, so
  `decode → encode_pam → decode` mismatched (left 6 bytes, right 3). The ASCII
  decoder (`decode_ascii_samples`) now sizes output by the *layout*: 2 raw bytes
  only for a genuinely 16-bit-per-channel layout (`Gray16`), and downscales
  16-bit samples to one `u8` for 8-bit layouts (16-bit P3 PPM → `Rgb8`), byte-for-byte
  matching the binary P6 path. The `Gray16` ASCII precision-preservation fix
  (zenpipe#51) is unchanged. Regression: `tests/roundtrip.rs`
  (`p3_ascii_ppm_16bit_downscales_to_rgb8`, `p3_ascii_and_p6_binary_16bit_agree`),
  plus the strengthened `tests/fuzz_regression.rs` `roundtrip` target (now asserts
  pixel-equality, not just no-panic) over seed
  `fuzz/regression/fuzz_roundtrip/pnm-p3-16bit-rgb8-roundtrip-zenbitmaps-10`.
- **`Gray16` decode byte order is now consistent across binary and ASCII PNM
  (#12).** `PixelLayout::Gray16` is documented native-endian, but the binary
  P5/P7 path returned the on-disk *big-endian* bytes verbatim
  (`decode_integer_transform`) while the ASCII P2 path emitted *native-endian*
  `u16` (`decode_ascii_samples`), so the same logical 16-bit image decoded to two
  different `pixels()` buffers on little-endian hosts — a consumer reinterpreting
  the bytes as `&[u16]` got byte-swapped values from binary inputs. The binary
  decode path now byte-swaps big-endian on-disk samples to host order, and
  `encode_pam` writes `Gray16` back out big-endian (converting from the
  native-endian buffer), mirroring the farbfeld `Rgba16` convention.
  **Behavior change (little-endian hosts only):** `decode()` of a binary 16-bit
  PGM/PAM now returns native-endian bytes where it previously returned
  big-endian; the on-disk PAM produced by `encode_pam` is unchanged
  (big-endian). `decode → encode_pam → decode` stays pixel-lossless, and is a
  no-op on big-endian hosts. Regressions: `tests/roundtrip.rs`
  (`p5_binary_gray16_decodes_native_endian`, `p5_binary_and_p2_ascii_gray16_agree`,
  `p7_pam_binary_gray16_agrees_with_ascii`, `pam_roundtrip_gray16_lossless`,
  `encode_pam_gray16_writes_big_endian_on_disk`).

### Docs

- README: overhauled to the zen* house conventions — standardized badge row
  (CI/crates.io/lib.rs/docs.rs/MSRV/license, flat-square, no `branch=`), a
  `## Quick start`, the rendered crosslink footer, and a generated, badge-free
  `README.crates.md` (`readme = "README.crates.md"`) so the GitHub and crates.io
  surfaces can't drift. Replaced the headline GiB/s table with a support matrix
  plus `benchmarks/README.md` methodology (no unverified numbers carried over),
  bumped the documented dependency version to 0.2, and corrected the QOI credit
  to a vendored rapid-qoi core.
- README: document the byte conventions that were previously undocumented and
  could cause silent pixel corruption in a downstream renderer — PFM row order
  (decoder normalizes the on-disk bottom-to-top scanlines to top-down) and
  endianness (scale sign selects file byte order; samples returned as
  native-endian `f32` with the scale magnitude applied), and `Gray16` byte order
  (decode returns native-endian `u16` from both binary P5/P7 and ASCII P2;
  `encode_pam` writes big-endian on disk — see #12, which reconciled the code
  paths these docs originally described as divergent). Also added the real
  `encode_*`/`DecodeOutput` signatures and
  field-vs-method shapes, the `encode_ppm` `maxval = 255` / RGB-only contract and
  its accepted/rejected layouts, the `Limits` units + the always-on 1 GiB
  `DEFAULT_MAX_MEMORY_BYTES` default cap (and that the zero-copy borrowed path is
  gated by dimension limits, not `max_memory_bytes`), and corrected the
  PPM/PAM decode-output layout table (PNM never yields `GrayAlpha*`/`Rgb16`/
  `Rgba16`; 16-bit RGB/RGBA downscale to 8-bit). Found via an insulated
  external-developer usability test of the published README.

### Fixed

- QOI/BMP encode of chroma-free RGB no longer fails with
  `UnsupportedVariant`. The load-bearing narrowing (see "Added" below)
  collapses an all-gray RGB(A) view to Gray8, but QOI and BMP have no
  grayscale encode path (QOI: RGB/RGBA/BGRA; BMP: 24-bit RGB / 32-bit
  RGBA), so the reduced buffer hit the encoders' error arm — an all-gray
  RGB image (e.g. solid black) panicked on encode. `reduce_for_raw_encode`
  is now codec-aware: each encoder passes a predicate for the layouts it
  can emit, and the reduction is used only if encodable, else the original
  (broader) view is encoded. Narrowing only ever loses encodability via
  the →Gray path, so PNM and TGA (which encode grayscale) are unchanged.
  Regression: `codec::tests::{qoi,bmp}_all_gray_rgb_not_narrowed_to_unencodable_gray`.
- RLE BMP decompression-bomb DoS: a 158-byte RLE4 BMP declaring width 1 / height ≈ 2.7e8 decoded in ~18 s (found by the fuzz farm). The ~134 MB declared output passed the 1 GiB cap, so the decoder allocated it and ran per-output-pixel post-processing over 268M pixels. Fixes: (1) `decode_rle4` now stops at input exhaustion (`!self.bytes.eof()`), matching `decode_rle8plus` — without it a truncated stream spun `*line` down from the declared height; (2) `decode_rle` rejects an output larger than the compressed stream could plausibly encode (256×-input ratio guard, 64 KiB floor). The repro now rejects in ~3 ms. Regression: `tests/bmp_rle_dos_regression.rs`.
- ASCII PNM (P2/P3) with `maxval > 255` now decodes as true 16-bit. `decode_ascii_samples` emitted a single downscaled `u8` per sample even though `maxval > 255` selects a 16-bit layout (e.g. Gray16) — producing half the bytes the layout declares. That overran `PixelBuffer::as_slice` (OOB panic, reached via `zencodecs::push_decode`, fuzz zenpipe#51) and silently dropped 16-bit precision. 16-bit samples are now emitted as 2 raw native-endian bytes (matching the binary Gray16 path) and out-of-range samples are clamped to `maxval`. Regression: `tests/pnm_ascii_16bit_regression.rs`.

### Added

- Load-bearing descriptor narrowing on the zencodec encode path
  (zenpixels-convert 0.2.13 `load_bearing` #30): PNM/QOI/BMP/TGA
  encoders reduce the input view to its bit-exact load-bearing form
  before format mapping — dead alpha drops (RGBA→RGB: PAM→PPM, QOI
  4→3 channels, BMP 32→24, TGA 32→24), chroma-free RGB collapses to
  gray, bit-replicated U16 narrows to U8. Raw formats pay full price
  for dead lanes (no entropy coder downstream), so the reduction wins
  more here than for any compressed codec. Live alpha / real chroma /
  genuine high bits suppress the reduction (scan-proven, never lossy);
  wiring test pins PPM-vs-PAM both ways. Farbfeld (fixed RGBA16) and
  HDR (RGBE) are structurally exempt.

### Changed

- zencodec 0.1.19 → 0.1.22; zenpixels 0.2.10 → 0.2.13;
  zenpixels-convert 0.2.13 added (optional, rides the `zencodec`
  feature).

### Changed

- Removed `tests/` and `benches/` from the published package `include` list; downstream consumers no longer receive ~444 KB of test fixtures and bench sources (local build/test/bench unaffected).
- Vendored the QOI codec core (descriptor, pixel traits, encode/decode kernels)
  from `rapid-qoi` v0.6.x into `src/qoi/rapid_qoi/`, and dropped the external
  `rapid-qoi` Cargo dependency (the `qoi` feature is now self-contained). The
  vendored kernel carries the `QOI_OP_RUN` clamp fix at the source, so both the
  whole-image and the streaming/row-by-row decode paths share one unified,
  clamped implementation; the previous native workaround
  (`src/qoi/run_decode.rs`) was retired and replaced by a thin
  `QoiDecodeState` wrapper over the vendored `decode_range`. Upstream's
  `bytemuck` slice casts were replaced with safe `<[u8]>::as_chunks` so the
  crate stays `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`-clean with no new direct dependency.
  Attribution preserved in each vendored file (© zakarumych, MIT OR
  Apache-2.0). Decoded pixels verified byte-identical to the reference `qoi`
  crate (0.4.1) across the corpus + synthetic run-heavy/run-at-edge images,
  both whole-image and row-by-row (e580b5e).

### Fixed

- BMP 8-bit grayscale (Gray8) decode is now byte-for-byte lossless on
  decode→encode→decode roundtrips. The 8bpp scanline reader shared the 24-bit
  RGB code path and wrongly applied the BGR↔RGB channel swap
  (`chunks_exact_mut(3).swap(0, 2)`) to single-channel Gray8 rows, scrambling
  pixels in 3-byte groups and dropping the trailing remainder on odd widths.
  The swap is now gated on `num_components == 3`, so Gray8 passes through
  untouched while 24-bit RGB behaviour is unchanged. This fixes the long-open
  `Fuzz (fuzz_roundtrip)` failure on 8bpp BMPs (the no-palette Gray8 crash and
  the paletted finding-#1 class). Encoders were already correct; the bug was
  purely in decode. Regression tests in `tests/roundtrip.rs` cover odd/even
  width Gray8 and odd-width paletted 8bpp (bc497d28).
- QOI decode no longer panics (`mid > len`) on spec-valid files where a
  `QOI_OP_RUN` chunk's run-length reaches the output-buffer edge / crosses a
  row boundary. The vendored `decode_range` clamps the run to the remaining
  output and carries the leftover across rows. Regression tests in
  `tests/roundtrip.rs` (a15fe87, #6, fixes #5).

### Changed

- `tests/fuzz_regression.rs` now uses the shared `zen-fuzz-regress`
  test-helper crate (DEDUP-J2). Behaviour is unchanged — same
  `fuzz/regression/` seeds, same two targets (`decode`, `roundtrip`),
  same panic-propagation failure semantics. The in-file `collect_seeds`
  scaffolding is now provided by `RegressionSuite`.

### Added

- Versioned public-API surface snapshot at `docs/public-api/zenbitmaps.txt`,
  regenerated by `tests/public_api_doc.rs` on every `cargo test` run
  (`ZEN_API_DOC=check` verifies in CI's clippy job, `=off` skips elsewhere);
  `just api-doc` / `just api-doc-check` recipes added.
- `tests/fuzz_regression.rs` regression-harness template ported from
  zenwebp (DEDUP-J). Walks `fuzz/regression/` (incl. per-target subdirs)
  and runs every seed through `decode`, `decode_bmp` (gated on `bmp`),
  `decode_farbfeld`, and the `encode_pam`/`encode_bmp[_rgba]` roundtrip
  on the stable toolchain — no nightly required.

- All encoders accept BGR/BGRA/BGRX input (automatic swizzle)
- Checked arithmetic throughout — no silent overflow on output size calculation

### Type safety

- `rgb` feature: typed pixel API (`RGB8`, `RGBA8`, `as_pixels()`, `encode_*_pixels()`)
- `imgref` feature: 2D buffer API (`ImgVec`/`ImgRef`, `as_imgref()`, `decode_into()`)
- `zencodec` feature: zencodec trait integration for pipeline use

### Design

- `no_std` + `alloc`, `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`, panic-free
- `BitmapError` is `#[non_exhaustive]`
- Fuzz targets included for PNM, BMP, and farbfeld decode paths
